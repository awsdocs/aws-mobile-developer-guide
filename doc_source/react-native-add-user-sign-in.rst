   * - **BEFORE YOU BEGIN**

     - The steps on this page assume you have already completed the steps on :ref:`Get Started <react-native-getting-started>`.


Set Up Your Backend
===================

The AWS Mobile CLI components for user authentication include a rich, configurable  UI for sign-up and sign-in.

**To enable the Auth features**

In the root folder of your app, run:

.. code-block:: java

      awsmobile user-signin enable

      awsmobile push

Connect to Your Backend
=======================

The AWS Mobile CLI enables you to integrate ready-made sign-up/sign-in/sign-out UI from the command line.

**To add user auth UI to your app**

#. Install AWS Amplify for React Nativelibrary.

   .. code-block:: bash

      npm install --save aws-amplify
      npm install --save aws-amplify-react-native

.. list-table::

   * - **Note**

     - If your react-native app was not created using :code:`create-react-native-app` or using a version of Expo lower than v25.0.0 (the engine behind  :code:`create-react-native-app`), you  need to link libraries in your project for the Auth module on React Native,  :code:`amazon-cognito-identity-js`.

       To link to the module, you must first eject the project:

       .. code-block:: bash

            npm run eject
            react-native link amazon-cognito-identity-js


#. Add the following import in :file:`App.js` (or other file that runs upon app startup):

   .. code-block:: java

      import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';

#. Then change :code:`export default App;` to the following.

   .. code-block:: java

      export default withAuthenticator(App);

To test, run :code:`npm start` or :code:`awsmobile run`.
