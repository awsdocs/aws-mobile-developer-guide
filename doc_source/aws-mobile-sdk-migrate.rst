Upgrade an Existing |AMH|-based App
###################################

.. meta::
   :description: Integrate |AMHlong| features into your existing mobile app. Quickly add a powerful
      cloud backend that scales in capacity and cost.

This section provides information about updating existing apps that use a |AMH| custom SDK to use the AWS
Mobile SDK version 2.6.x.

If you did not download custom files from |AMH| and incorporate them into your app, try starting at
:ref:`getting-started`.

.. _aws-mobile-sdk-migrate-overview:

Overview
========


In previous versions of the SDK, |AMH| app makers downloaded and incorporated a folder
(:file:`AmazonAws` for iOS, :file:`amazonaws` for Android) containing an SDK and helper code. The
SDK and helper code were customized to use the unique AWS resources created for each |AMH| project.

In 2.6.+, the SDK is simpler to use. Functions that previously resided in the
Mobile Hub-supplied helper code have been moved into the SDK. To tie an app's code to the unique AWS
resources of its |AMH| project, you can now download and incorporate a single configuration file,
:file:`awsconfiguration.json`.


.. _aws-mobile-sdk-migrate-changes-build:

Add the SDK to Your App
=======================


#. Download your |AMH| project configuration file.


   #. In the |AMH| console, choose your project, and then choose the :guilabel:`Integrate` icon on the left.

   #. Choose :guilabel:`Download Configuration File` to get the :file:`awsconfiguration.json` file
      that connects your app to your backend.

   #. Optionally, if you have enabled NoSQL Database or Cloud Logic, under :guilabel:`NoSQL / Cloud
      Logic` at the bottom of the page, choose the :guilabel:`Downloads` menu, then choose your
      platform.

      :emphasis:`Remember:`

      Each time you change the |AMH| project for your app, download and use an updated
      :file:`awsconfiguration.json` to reflect those changes in your app. If NoSQL Database or
      Cloud Logic are changed, also download and use updated files for those features.

   #. Incorporate your configuration file(s) into your app.

            #. From the location where configuration files were downloaded in a previous step, drag
               :file:`awsconfiguration.json` into the :file:`res/raw` folder.

            #. If NoSQL Database is enabled in your project, from the location where you downloaded
               the data model file(s), drag and drop each file with the form of
               :file:`{your-table-name}DO.java` into the folder that contains your main activity.

            #. If Cloud Logic is enabled in your project:, from the location where you downloaded the
               data model file(s), drag and drop all files in your project folder.  They should appear
               in the Java package structure.

         Android - Kotlin

#. Required Upgrade Steps

   .. container:: option

      Android - Java
         #. Add identity providers you want to enable to the app using Gradle.

            .. code-block:: none
               :emphasize-lines: 0, 2, 4, 6

                implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-facebook:2.6.+@aar')  {transitive = true;} // optional
                implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-google:2.6.+@aar')  {transitive = true;}  // optional
                implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-userpools:2.6.+@aar')  {transitive = true;}   // optional
                implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-ui:2.6.+@aar')  {transitive = true;}    // required for auth in 2.6.+

            If you encounter more than one version of a library, choose the one that begins with
            :code:`com.amazonaws.mobile.auth`.

         #. Increment the version number of your :code:`aws-android-sdk` from the following:

            .. code-block:: none

                implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-s3:2.4.7'

            To the followin:

            .. code-block:: none

                implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-s3:2.6.+'

         #. Use the new SDK-provided sign-in UI.

            The SDK now offers a library that implements an integrated sign-in UI for Facebook,
            Google, and |COG| user pools. If your app use components downloaded from Mobile
            Hub to make your sign-in UI, you can replace them with the following steps.

            Follow the steps in :ref:`add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in`

         #. Replace |SNS| with Amazon Pinpoint

            |AMH| now supports use of Amazon Pinpoint for push notifications. Amazon Pinpoint ties together
            messaging, including push, e-mail, and SMS, with Analytics. Each component can be used
            separately to communicate with users and their devices. Usage data gathered through
            analytics can be used to drive messaging campaigns.

            You can continue to use PushManager framework in an app that uses the new SDK, but you
            must maintain that code going forward.

                   end

         #. Use the constants provided in the :file:`awsconfiguration.json` you downloaded instead
            of AWS values in :file:`info.plist`. The AWS values in :file:`info.plist` should be
            deleted.

         #. Replace :code:`AWSMobileHubHelper` functions.

            If your app requires user sign-in:


            * Change your import statement from the following:

              .. code-block:: none

                  import AWSAuthCore

              To the following:

              .. code-block:: none
                 :emphasize-lines: 0

                  import AWSMobileHubHelper

            If your app uses :code:`ContentManager` or :code:`UserFilemanager`:


            * :code:`AWSMobileHubHelper` framework's :code:`UserFileManager` and
              :code:`ContentManager` have been incorporated into the SDK's :code:`AWSContentManager`
              API. To use :code:`AWSContentManager`, change your import statement from the following:

              .. code-block:: none

                  import AWSMobileHubHelper

              To the following:

              .. code-block:: none
                 :emphasize-lines: 0

                  import AWSContentManager

              To continue to use calls to :code:`UserFileManager` and
              :code:`ContentManager`, download and incorporate components from the demo application
              for your |AMH| project using the following steps.

              #. Open the |AMH| console, choose your project, and then choose :guilabel:`Integrate`
                 on the left.

              #. Under :guilabel:`Demo Application`, choose :guilabel:`Download`.

              #. Copy the :file:`MySampleApp/Sdk/Aws/AWSMobileHubContentManager.framework` folder
                 from the sample app into your Xcode project.

              #. Use the following import to make the API available.

                 .. code-block:: none

                     import AWSMobileHubContentManager

         #. Use the new SDK-provided sign-in UI

            The SDK now offers a library that implements an integrated sign-in UI for Facebook,
            Google, and |COG| user pools. If your app use components downloaded from |AMH| to make your sign-in UI, you can replace them with the following steps.


            #. Delete the :file:`SignIn` folder.

            #. Delete :code:`IdentityProfiles` registration from :file:`AWSMobileClient.swift` (no longer supported).

            #. Change the callback method signature from :code:`(result, authState, error)` to
               :code:`(result, error)` for calls to :code:`AWSSignInManager`.

            #. Follow the steps in :ref:`add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in`.

         #. Change your push notification backend from |SNS| to Amazon Pinpoint

            |AMH| now supports use of Amazon Pinpoint for push notifications. Amazon Pinpoint ties together
            messaging, including push, e-mail, and SMS, with Analytics. Each component can be used
            separately to communicate with users and their devices. Usage data gathered through
            analytics can be used to drive messaging campaigns.

            :code:`AWSMobileHubHelper` framework's :code:`UPushManager` is being replaced by the
            SDK's :code:`AWSPinpoint` API. To use :code:`AWSContentManager` change your import
            statement from the following:

            .. code-block:: none

                import AWSMobileHubHelper

            To the following:

            .. code-block:: none
               :emphasize-lines: 1

                import AWSPinpoint

            Follow the steps in :ref:`add-aws-mobile-push-notifications`.
