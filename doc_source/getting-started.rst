Overview
========

The AWS Mobile Android and iOS SDKs help you build high quality mobile apps quickly and easily. They provide easy access to a range of AWS services, including Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Pinpoint and many more.

.. _add-aws-mobile-sdk-basic-setup:

Set Up Your Backend
===================

#. `Sign up for the AWS Free Tier. <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`__

#. `Create a Mobile Hub project <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/>`__ by signing into the console. The Mobile Hub console provides a single location for managing and monitoring your app's cloud resources.

   To integrate existing AWS resources using the SDK directly, without Mobile Hub, see :doc:`Setup  Options for Android <how-to-android-sdk-setup>` or :doc:`Setup  Options for iOS <how-to-ios-sdk-setup>`.

#. Name your project, check the box to allow Mobile Hub to administer resources for you and then choose :guilabel:`Add`.

      #. Choose the :guilabel:`Download Cloud Config` and then choose :guilabel:`Next`.

         The :file:`awsconfiguration.json` file you download contains the configuration of backend resources that |AMH| enabled in your project. Analytics cloud services are enabled for your app by default.

      #. Add the backend service configuration file to your app.

         In the Project Navigator, right-click your app's :file:`res` folder, and then choose :guilabel:`New > Directory`. Type :userinput:`raw` as the directory name and then choose :guilabel:`OK`.

         From the location where configuration file, :file:`awsconfiguration.json`, was downloaded in a previous step, drag it into the :file:`res/raw` folder.  Android gives a resource ID to any arbitrary file placed in this folder, making it easy to reference in the app.

Connect to Your Backend
=======================

.. container:: option

   Android - Java
      #. Prerequisites

         * `Install Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads>`__ version 2.33 or higher.

         * Install Android SDK v7.11 (Nougat), API level 25.

      #. Your :file:`AndroidManifest.xml` must contain:

         .. code-block:: xml

             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

      #. Add dependencies to your :file:`app/build.gradle`, then choose :guilabel:`Sync Now` in the upper right of Android Studio. This libraries enable basic AWS functions, like credentials, and analytics.

         .. code-block:: java

             dependencies {
                 implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.6.+@aar') { transitive = true }
             }

      #. Add the following code to the :code:`onCreate` method of your main or startup activity. :code:`AWSMobileClient` is a singleton that establishes your connection to |AWS| and acts as an interface for your services.

         .. code-block:: java

            import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSMobileClient;

              public class YourMainActivity extends Activity {
                @Override
                protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

                    AWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(this, new AWSStartupHandler() {
                        @Override
                        public void onComplete(AWSStartupResult awsStartupResult) {
                            Log.d("YourMainActivity", "AWSMobileClient is instantiated and you are connected to AWS!");
                        }
                    }).execute();

                    // More onCreate code ...
                }
              }

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 1 6

            * - What does this do?

              - When :code:`AWSMobileClient` is initialized, it constructs the :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider` and :code:`AWSConfiguration` objects which, in turn, are used when creating other SDK clients. The client then makes a `Sigv4 signed <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html>`__ network call to `Amazon Cognito Federated Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html>`__ to retrieve AWS credentials that provide the user access to your backend resources. When the network interaction succeeds, the :code:`onComplete` method of the :code:`AWSStartUpHandler` is called.

      Your app is now set up to interact with the AWS services you configured in your Mobile Hub project!

      Choose the run icon (|play|) in Android Studio to build your app and run it on your device/emulator. Look for :code:`Welcome to AWS!` in your Android Logcat output (choose :guilabel:`View > Tool Windows > Logcat`).

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 1

         * - **Optional:** The following example shows how to retrieve the reference to :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider` and :code:`AWSConfiguration` objects which can be used to instantiate other SDK clients. You can use the :code:`IdentityManager` to fetch the user's AWS identity id either directly from Amazon Cognito or from the locally cached identity id value.

             .. code-block:: java

                import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentialsProvider;
                import com.amazonaws.mobile.auth.core.IdentityHandler;
                import com.amazonaws.mobile.auth.core.IdentityManager;

                import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSStartupResult;
                import com.amazonaws.mobile.config.AWSConfiguration;

                public class YourMainActivity extends Activity {

                    private AWSCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider;
                    private AWSConfiguration configuration;

                    @Override
                    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

                        AWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(this, new AWSStartupHandler() {
                            @Override
                            public void onComplete(AWSStartupResult awsStartupResult) {

                                // Obtain the reference to the AWSCredentialsProvider and AWSConfiguration objects
                                credentialsProvider = AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getCredentialsProvider();
                                configuration = AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getConfiguration();

                                // Use IdentityManager#getUserID to fetch the identity id.
                                IdentityManager.getDefaultIdentityManager().getUserID(new IdentityHandler() {
                                    @Override

                                        Log.d("YourMainActivity", "Identity ID = " + identityId);

                                        // Use IdentityManager#getCachedUserID to
                                        //  fetch the locally cached identity id.
                                        final String cachedIdentityId =
                                            IdentityManager.getDefaultIdentityManager().getCachedUserID();
                                    }

               - Remember to always use :file:`./YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.xcworkspace` to open your Xcode project from now on.

      #. Rebuild your app after reopening it in the workspace to resolve APIs from new libraries called in your code. This is a good practice any time you add import statements.

      #. Replace the :code:`return true` statement in :code:`didFinishLaunching` with the following code in your AppDelegate to establish a run-time connection with AWS Mobile.

         .. code-block:: swift

            import UIKit
            import AWSMobileClient

            @UIApplicationMain
            class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

            func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                             didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
                // Override point for customization after application launch.

                // Create AWSMobileClient to connect with AWS
                return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(
                    application,
                    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)

            }

            * - What does this do?

              - When :code:`AWSMobileClient` is initialized, it makes a `Sigv4 signed <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html>`__ network call to `Amazon Cognito Federated Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html>`__ to retrieve AWS credentials that provide the user access to your backend resources. When the network interaction succeeds, the :code:`onComplete` method of the :code:`AWSStartUpHandler` is called.

      Your app is now set up to interact with the AWS services you configured in your |AMH| project!

      Choose the run icon (|play|) in the top left of the Xcode window or type |Acommand|-R to build and run your app. Look for  :code:`Welcome to AWS!` in the log output.

         * - **Optional:** If you want to make sure you're connected to AWS, import :code:`AWSCore` and add the following code to :code:`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` before you return :code:`AWSMobileClient`.

             .. code-block:: swift

                  import AWSCore

                        //. . .

                  AWSDDLog.add(AWSDDTTYLogger.sharedInstance)
                  AWSDDLog.sharedInstance.logLevel = .info

             **Optional:** The following example shows how to retrieve the reference to :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider` object which can be used to instantiate other SDK clients. You can use the :code:`AWSIdentityManager` to fetch the AWS identity id of the user from Amazon Cognito.

             .. code-block:: swift

                  import UIKit
                  import AWSMobileClient
                  import AWSAuthCore

                  class ViewController: UIViewController {

                      @IBOutlet weak var textfield: UITextField!
                      override func viewDidLoad() {
                          super.viewDidLoad()
                          textfield.text = "View Controller Loaded"

                          // Get the AWSCredentialsProvider from the AWSMobileClient
                          let credentialsProvider = AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().getCredentialsProvider()

                          // Get the identity Id from the AWSIdentityManager
                          let identityId = AWSIdentityManager.default().identityId
                      }
                  }
