Set Up Your Backend
==================

#. `Sign up for the AWS Free Tier. <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`_

#. Enable by agreeing to have AWS services created and managed for your when you use the console.

#. `Create a |AMH| project <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home?>`_ by signing into the console. The Mobile Hub console provides a single location for managing and monitoring your app's cloud resources.

#. |AMH| generates a cloud configuration file that contains information about your resource identifiers that are required by the Mobile SDK. Choose :guilabel:`Integrate` on the left, and then choose the :guilabel:`Download` link in the first step of the page. Add the downloaded the configuration file to your app:

.. container:: option

  Android - Java
       From your download, drag the :file:`awsconfiguration.json` file into the :file:`raw` folder in :file:`./app/src/main/res/raw` of your Android Studio project.

  iOS - Swift
       From your download, drag the :file:`awsconfiguration.json` file into the folder containing your :file:`info.plist` file in your Xcode project.

       Select :guilabel:`Copy items if needed` and :guilabel:`Create groups` in the options dialog.

Connect to Your Backend
====================

.. container:: option

   Android - Java
      #. Prerequisites
         Install Android Studio version 2.33 or higher.
         Install Android SDK v7.11 (Nougat), API level 25.

      #. Your AndroidManifest.xml must contain:

         .. code-block:: xml

             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

      #. Add dependencies to your :file:`app/build.gradle`. These libraries enable basic
         AWS functions, like credentials, and analytics.

         .. code-block:: java

             dependencies {
                 compile ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.6.7@aar') { transitive = true; }
             }

      #. Add the following code to the :code:`onCreate` method of your main or startup activity to
         establish a connection with AWS Mobile. AWSMobileClient is a singleton that will be your
         interface between all the AWS services.

         .. code-block:: java

            import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSMobileClient;

              public class YourMainActivity extends Activity {
                @Override
                protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

                    AWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(this).execute();
                 }
              }

         Choose the Run icon in Android Studio to build your app and run it on your device/emulator.
         Your app is now set up to interact with the AWS services you configured in your Mobile Hub
         project! You should see a log in your Android logcat saying "**Welcome to AWS!**".


   iOS - Swift
      #. Pre-requisites

         Install Xcode version 8.0 or later.

      #. Install Cocoapods. From a terminal window run:

         .. code-block:: bash

            sudo gem install cocoapods

      #. Create :file:`Podfile`. From a terminal window, navigate to the directory that contains your project's :file:`.xcodeproj` file and run: :code: `pod init`.


      #. Add core AWS Mobile SDK components to your build.

         .. code-block:: none

              platform :ios, '9.0'
              target :'YourAppTarget' do
                  use_frameworks!
                  pod 'AWSMobileClient', '~> 2.6.6'
                  # other pods
              end

         Run :code:`pod install --repo-update` to install the dependencies.

         .. list-table::
             :widths: 1 6

             * - Use **ONLY** your .xcworkspace

               - After you initialize Cocoapods for your project, close your Xcode project and do not use it again. Instead, use the .xcworkspace file generated by cocoapods for all further development.

      #. Add the following code to your AppDelegate to establish a run-time connection with AWS Mobile.

         .. code-block:: swift

            import UIKit
            import AWSMobileClient

            @UIApplicationMain
            class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

              func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:
                    [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
                        return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
              }
            }

      #. `Optional`: If you want to make sure you're connected to AWS, add the following code to your AppDelegate.

         .. code-block:: swift

            import AWSCore

            AWSDDLog.add(AWSDDTTYLogger.sharedInstance)
            AWSDDLog.sharedInstance.logLevel = .info

        Your app is now set up to interact with the AWS services you configured in your |AMH| project! Choose the run icon in the top left of the Xcode window or type Command-R to build and run your app. You should see a log in your output saying "**Welcome to AWS!**".
