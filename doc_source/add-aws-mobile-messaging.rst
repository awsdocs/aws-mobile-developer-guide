Overview
========


Engage your users more deeply by tying their app usage behavior to messaging campaigns.

When you enable the AWS Mobile Hub :ref:`messaging-and-analytics` feature, your app is registered with the
Amazon Pinpoint service. You can define User Segments and send E-mail, SMS, and :ref:`Push
Notification <add-aws-mobile-push-notifications>` messages to those recipients through the Amazon Pinpoint
console.

Amazon Pinpoint also enables you to gather and visualize your app's :ref:`Analytics
<add-aws-mobile-analytics>`. The metrics you gather can be as simple as session start and stop data,
or you can customize them to show things like how closely actual behavior matches your predicted model.

You can then algorithmically tie messaging campaigns to user behavior. For instance, send a discount
mail to frequent users, or send a push notification that initiates a data sync for users that have
selected a certain category in a feature of your app.
