   * - **Looking for the AWS SDKs for iOS and Android?** These SDKs and their docs are now part of `AWS Amplify <https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs>`__.

       The content on this page applies only to apps that were configured using AWS Mobile Hub or awsmobile CLI. For existing apps that use AWS Mobile SDK prior to v2.8.0, we highly recommend you migrate your app to use `AWS Amplify <https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs>`__ and the latest SDK.


|AMHlong| is a service that enables even a novice to easily deploy and configure mobile app backend
features using a range of powerful AWS services.

You create a free project, then choose and configure mobile app features using a point and click
console. |AMH| takes care of the complexities in the background and then supplies you with step by
step integration instructions.
