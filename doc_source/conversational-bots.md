AWS Mobile Hub conversational bots bring your mobile app the same natural language understanding and business logic integration that power the Amazon Alexa and Amazon Shopping voice and text conversation experiences\.

Mobile Hub conversational bots use Amazon Lex, an AWS service for building voice and text conversational interfaces into applications\. Amazon Lex has built\-in integration with Lambda\.

With conversational bots and Amazon Lex, no deep learning expertise is necessary\. Specify the basic conversation flow in the Amazon Lex console to create a bot\. The service manages the dialogue and dynamically adjusts the responses in the conversation\. Using Mobile Hub conversation bots, you can provision and test bots based on demonstration templates or bots you have created in the Amazon Lex console\. Mobile Hub provides integration instructions and customized components for reusing the sample app code we generate in your own app\.
