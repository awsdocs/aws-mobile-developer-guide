+ Distribute your content through a global Content Delivery Network \(CDN\)
+ Stream your media

 [Create a free Mobile Hub project with Hosting and Streaming\. Get a custom sample app and SDK\.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home#/) 

## Feature Details<a name="hosting-and-streaming-details"></a>

The Hosting and Streaming feature delivers content through a global network of endpoints using [Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)\.

The following image shows how website assets and streaming media are distributed to a mobile web app or browser\. The web app is shown requesting AWS credentials and accessing AWS services through the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html)\.

The following image shows a native or hybrid mobile app requesting AWS credentials to access content from a CDN edge location\.

The Hosting and Streaming feature enables you to host website and app assets in the cloud, such as HTML, JavaScript, image, or media files\. Mobile Hub creates a content source storage location \(origin\) using an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) bucket\. The bucket is made accessible to the internet through the Amazon S3 ability to statically host web content with no web server\.

Low latency access to your content is provided to users in all regions by caching your source content on a global network of edge locations\. This Content Distribution network \(CDN\) is provided through an [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) distribution which also supports media file streaming \(see [Amazon CloudFront streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/streaming/)\)\.

## Web App Support<a name="webapp-hosting-and-streaming"></a>

When you enable Hosting and Streaming, Mobile Hub provisions a local copy of the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html) in the root of your bucket\.

Mobile Hub also generates the project configuration files `aws-config.js` and `aws-exports.js`, which contain endpoint constants for each AWS services Mobile Hub configured for your project\. `aws-exports.js` is provided for integration with ES6 compatible scripting languages like Node\.js\. Use these values to make SDK calls to your services from your hosted web app\.

**Note**  
Best security practice is to reduce access to an app’s resources as much as possible\. These configuration files are publically accessible and contain identifiers for all of your app’s AWS resources\. If it suits your design, we recommend you protect your resources by allowing only authenticated users to access them\. You can do this in this project by enabling the Mobile Hub [User Sign\-in](User-Sign-in.md#user-sign-in) with the **Require sign\-in** option\.

You can also copy the appropriate configuration file into your hybrid native/web mobile app to enable calling your AWS services from your app using JavaScript\.

### Browsing Your Content<a name="browse-hosting-and-streaming"></a>

With Hosting and Streaming enabled, you have several options:
+  **Launch from Amazon S3**: This option browses to the un\-cached index\.html in the root of your source bucket\.
+  **Launch from Amazon CloudFront**: This option browses to the index\.html that is cached on the CDN edge servers\.
**Note**  
Provisioning the edge locations for the distribution can take up to an hour\. This link will not resolve until the distribution finishes propagating in the network\.
+  **Manage files**: This option opens the Amazon S3 console to review and manage the contents of your source bucket\. You can also find your bucket in the Amazon S3 console by opening your project in Mobile Hub and then choosing the **Resources** icon on the left\. The name of the bucket configured for Hosting and Streaming contains the string `hosting`\.

### Managing Your App Assets<a name="managing-hosting-and-streaming"></a>

You can choose from a variety of ways to manage your web app assets through use of the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\) or one of the many third party applications available\.

#### Using the Amazon S3 Console<a name="console-hosting-and-streaming"></a>

To use the Amazon S3 console to review, upload, move or delete your files stored in your bucket, navigate to the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) and choose the bucket whose name contains your project name\. Your web app content will reside in the root folder\.

#### Using AWS CLI<a name="cli-hosting-and-streaming"></a>

AWS CLI allows you to review, upload, move or delete your files stored in your bucket using the command line\.

To install and configure the AWS CLI client, see [Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html)\.

As an example, the sync command enables transfer of files to and from your local folder \(`source`\) and your bucket \(`destination`\)\.

 `$ aws s3 sync {source destination} [--options]` 

The following command syncs all files from your current local folder to the folder in your web app’s bucket defined by `path`\.

 `$ aws s3 sync . s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/path` 

To learn more about using AWS CLI to manage Amazon S3, see [Using Amazon S3 with the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-s3.html) 

### Using a Custom Domain for Your Web App<a name="domains-hosting-and-streaming"></a>

To configure your Hosting and Streaming CDN as the destination of your custom domain, see [Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html)\.
