|   **Looking for the AWS SDKs for iOS and Android?** These SDKs and their docs are now part of [AWS Amplify](https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs)\. The content on this page applies only to apps that were configured using AWS Mobile Hub or awsmobile CLI\. For existing apps that use AWS Mobile SDK prior to v2\.8\.0, we highly recommend you migrate your app to use [AWS Amplify](https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs) and the latest SDK\.  | 

The configuration settings of your Mobile Hub project are stored in the AWS US East \(Virginia\) region\.

The AWS services you configure are hosted in the region you select for your project, if they are available in that region\. If services are not available in that region, then Mobile hub will host the services in another region\.

For more details about regional endpoints, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)\.

To understand where services for your project will be hosted, find the region for your project in the following tables\.
