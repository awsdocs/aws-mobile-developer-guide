# AWS Mobile Hub Features<a name="mobile-hub-react-native-aws-mobile-reference"></a>

**Important**  
The following content applies if you are already using the AWS Mobile CLI to configure your backend\. If you are building a new mobile or web app, or youâ€™re adding cloud capabilities to your existing app, use the new [AWS Amplify CLI](http://aws-amplify.github.io/) instead\. With the new Amplify CLI, you can use all of the features described in [Announcing the AWS Amplify CLI toolchain](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-the-aws-amplify-cli-toolchain/), including AWS CloudFormation functionality that provides additional workflows\.
