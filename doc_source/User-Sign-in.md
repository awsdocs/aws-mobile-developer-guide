|   **Looking for the AWS SDKs for iOS and Android?** These SDKs and their docs are now part of [AWS Amplify](https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs)\. The content on this page applies only to apps that were configured using AWS Mobile Hub or awsmobile CLI\. For existing apps that use AWS Mobile SDK prior to v2\.8\.0, we highly recommend you migrate your app to use [AWS Amplify](https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs) and the latest SDK\.  | 

Choose the AWS Mobile Hub User Sign\-in mobile backend feature to:
+ Add AWS user authentication and secure identity access management to your mobile app\.

   Note: Secure unauthenticated access to AWS resources is available to all Mobile Hub projects with or without the User Sign\-in feature\. 
+ Enable your users to sign\-in to access AWS resources with existing credentials from identity providers like Facebook, Google, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services or your own custom user directory\.

 [Create a free Mobile Hub project and add the User Sign\-in feature\.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home#/) 

## Feature Details<a name="user-sign-in-details"></a>

This feature enables you to configure how your users gain access to AWS resources and services used by your app, either with no sign in process or through authentication provided by one or more identity providers\. In both cases, AWS identity creation and credentials are provided by [Amazon Cognito Identity](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/dev-resources/), and access authorization comes through [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/)\.

When you create a project, Mobile Hub provisions the AWS identity, user role, and access policy configuration required to allow all users access to unrestricted resources\. When you add the User Sign\-in feature to your app, you are able to restrict access to allow only those who sign in with credentials validated by an identity provider to use protected resources\. Through Amazon Cognito Identity, your app user obtains AWS credentials to directly access the AWS services that you enabled and configured for your Mobile Hub project\. Both authenticated and unauthenticated users are granted temporary, limited\-privilege credentials with the same level of security enforcement\.

Amazon Cognito can federate validated user identities from multiple identity providers to a single AWS identity\. Mobile Hub helps you integrate identity providers into your mobile app so that users can sign in using their existing credentials from Facebook, Google, and your own identity system\. You can also create and configure your own email\- and password\-based user directory using Amazon Cognito Your User Pools\.

|   **AWS services and resources configured**   |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/User-Sign-in.html) For more information, see [Viewing AWS Resources Provisioned for this Feature](#resources-user-sign-in)\.  | 
|   **Configuration options**   |  This feature enables the following mobile backend capabilities:  **Sign\-in Providers** \(users gain greater access when they sign in\)  | 
+ via **Google** authentication \(see [Using Amazon Cognito Hosted UI](https://docs.amplify.aws/sdk/auth/hosted-ui/q/platform/ios#using-amazon-cognito-hosted-ui)\)
  + via **Facebook** authentication \(see mobile\-auth\-setup\)
  + via **Email and Password** authentication \(see [User Sign\-in Providers](#user-sign-in-provider)\)
  + via **SAML Federation** authentication \(see [User Sign\-in Providers](#user-sign-in-provider)\)

   **Required Sign\-in** \(authenticated access\)

   **Optional Sign\-in** \(users gain greater access when they sign in\) For more information, see [Configuring User Sign\-in](#config-user-sign-in) 
  + 
    +  **Quickstart demo features** 
    + This feature adds the following to a quickstart app generated by Mobile Hub:
      + Unauthenticated access \(if allowed by your app’s configuration\), displaying the ID that AWS assigns to the app instance’s device\.
      + Sign\-in screen that authenticates users using the selected method: Facebook, Google, or Email and Password \(your own user pool\)\.
      + With **Optional Sign\-in** and **Require Sign\-in**, the app demonstrates an access barrier to protected folders for unauthenticated users\.

## Configuring User Sign\-in<a name="config-user-sign-in"></a>

The following options are available for configuring your users’ sign\-in experience\.

### User Sign\-in Providers<a name="user-sign-in-provider"></a>

Facebook
+ To enable Facebook user authentication, register your application with Facebook\.

  If you already have a registered Facebook app, copy the App ID from the Facebook Developers App Dashboard\. Paste the ID into the Facebook App ID field and choose Save Changes\.

  If you do not have a Facebook App ID yet, you’ll need to create one before you can integrate Facebook in your mobile app\. The Facebook Developers portal takes you through the process of setting up your Facebook application\.

  For full instructions on integrating your application with Facebook, see [Setting Up Facebook Authentication](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login)\.

Google
+ To authenticate your users through Google, fully integrate your sample app with Google\+ Sign\-in\.

  If you already have a registered Google Console project with the Google\+ API, a web application OAuthClient and a client ID for the platform of your choice set up, then copy and paste the Google Web App Client ID and client ID\(s\) from the Google Developers Console into those fields and choose **Save Changes**\.

  Regardless of the platform you choose \(Android or iOS\), you’ll need to at least create the following\.
  + A Google Console project with the Google\+ API enabled \(used for Google Sign\-in\)
  + A web application OAuth client ID
  + An iOS and/or Android client ID, depending on which platform you are supporting

  For full instructions on integrating your application with Google\+, see :[Setting Up Google Authentication](https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/)\.

Email and Password
+ Choose Email and Password sign\-in when you want to create your own AWS\-managed user directory and sign\-in process for your app’s users\. Configure the characteristics of their sign\-in experience by:
  + Selecting user login options \(*email, username, and/or phone number*\)
  + Enabling multi\-factor authentication \(*none, required, optional*\) which adds delivery of an entry code via text message to a user’s phone, and a prompt to enter that code along with the other factor to sign\-in
  + Selecting password character requirements \(*minimum length, upper/lower cases, numbers or special characters allowed*\)\.

SAML Federation
+ SAML Federation enables users with credentials in your existing identity store to sign in to your mobile app using their familiar username and password\. A user signs into to your identity provider \(IdP\) which is configured to return a validating SAML assertion\. Your app then uses Amazon Cognito Federated Identities to exchange the SAML assertion for typical temporary, limited privilege credentials to access your AWS backend services\.

  SAML 2\.0 \(Security Assertion Markup Language 2\.0\) is an open standard used by many IdPs, including Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service and Shibboleth\. Your IdP must be SAML 2\.0 compatible to use this Mobile Hub option\. To establish federation between AWS and your IdP the two systems must exchange SAML federation metadata\. AWS federation metadata can be found at [https://signin\.aws\.amazon\.com/static/saml\-metadata\.xml](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/static/saml-metadata.xml)\. This xml file demonstrates the form that your IdP’s metadata should take\. For more information on SAML federation metadata for your IdP, see [Integrating Third\-Party SAML Solution Providers with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml_3rd-party.html)\.

  To implement this exchange:

  1. View your IdP’s documentation to understand how to use the AWS federation metadata file to register AWS as a service provider\.

  1. Ensure that your Mobile Hub project is configured to use Email & Password sign\-in to create an Amazon Cognito User Pool\.

  1. Configure your IdP as an Identity Provider for your user pool using the steps on [Creating SAML Identity Providers for Your User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-saml-idp.html)\.

  To learn more about how AWS supports SAML federation, see [Overview of Configuring SAML 2\.0\-Based Federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html)\.

### User Sign\-in Requirement<a name="user-sign-in-requirement"></a>

Sign\-in is optional
+ Users have the option to sign in \(authenticate\) with your chosen sign\-in identity provider\(s\) or users can skip sign\-in \(unauthenticated\)\. Your app receives temporary, limited privilege access credentials from Amazon Cognito Identity as either an authenticated user or an unauthenticated guest user so that your app can access your AWS services securely\.

Sign\-in is required
+ Users are required to sign in with one of your chosen sign\-in providers\. Your app receives temporary, limited privilege access credentials from Amazon Cognito Identity as an authenticated user so that your app can access your AWS services securely\.

**Note**  
If user sign\-in is not required, unauthenticated users can access to data in your database tables and files in your storage buckets, unless those resources are explicitly restricted through another mechanism\.

### User Sign\-in and AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)<a name="user-sign-in-iam"></a>

When your mobile app is saved, Mobile Hub creates an Amazon Cognito identity pool and a new IAM role\. These are used to generate temporary AWS credentials for the quickstart app users to access your AWS resources\. The AWS IAM role security policies are updated based on the sign\-in features enabled\.

At this point, your mobile project is set up for users to sign in\. Each chosen identity provider has been added to the login screen of the quickstart app\.

For more information, see [Control Access to Mobile Hub Projects](reference-mobile-hub-iam-managed-policies.md)\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/images/resources-user-sign-in.png)

## Quickstart App Details<a name="quickstart-user-sign-in"></a>

In the Mobile Hub quickstart app, the User Sign\-in demo enables users to use features that access AWS resources without authentication or by signing in to the app via identity providers including Facebook, Google, SAML Federation or Email and Password\.

When you add User Sign\-in to your project with the **Optional Sign\-in** option, choosing the app’s quickstart sign\-in demo returns and displays the user’s Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID\. This identifier is associated with the app instance’s device currently accessing AWS resources\.

When you add User Sign\-in to your project with **Required Sign\-in**, choosing the app’s quickstart sign\-in demo displays a sign\-in experience branded to match the identity provider\(s\) configured in the project\. Signing in to the demo authenticates the user in the selected identity provider service and returns and displays the Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID identifier of the user\.
