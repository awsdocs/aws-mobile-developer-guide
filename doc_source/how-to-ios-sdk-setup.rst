To add the SDK, install the following on your development machine:

- Xcode 7 or later

- iOS 8 or later

You can view the source code in the `AWS Mobile SDK for iOS GitHub repository <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios>`__.

.. _include_sdk_ios:

Include the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS in an Existing Application
-------------------------------------------------------------

The samples included with the SDK are standalone projects that are already set up. You can also integrate the SDK into your own existing project. Choose one of the following three ways to import the SDK into your project:

- Cocoapods
- Carthage
- Dynamic Frameworks

.. note:: Importing the SDK in multiple ways loads duplicate copies of the SDK into the project and causes compiler errors.

.. _set-up-options:

.. container:: option

    CocoaPods
        #. The AWS Mobile SDK for iOS is available through `CocoaPods <http://cocoapods.org/>`__. Install CocoaPods by running the following commands from the folder containing your projects :file:`*.xcodeproj` file.

            $ :command:`gem install cocoapods`

            .. note::

               Depending on your system settings, you may need to run the command as administrator using `sudo`, as follows:

            $ :command:`sudo gem install cocoapods`

            $ :command:`pod setup`

            $ :command:`pod init`

        #. In your project directory (the directory where your :file:`*.xcodeproj` file is), open the empty text file named :file:`Podfile` (without a file extension) and add the following lines to the file. Replace ``myAppName`` with your app name. You can also remove pods for services that you don't use. For example, if you don't use `AWSAutoScaling`, remove or do not include the ``AWSAutoScaling`` pod.

              Once you have created a workspace, always use `*.xcworkspace` to open the project instead of :file:`*.xcodeproj`.

        #. Rebuild your app after reopening it in the workspace to resolve APIs from new libraries called in your code. This is a good practice any time you add import statements.


    Carthage
        #. Install the latest version of `Carthage <https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage>`__.

        #. Add the following to your `Cartfile`::

            github "aws/aws-sdk-ios"

        #. Run the following command:

            $ :command:`carthage update`

        #. With your project open in Xcode, choose your **Target**. In the **General** tab, find **Embedded Binaries**,  then choose the **+** button.

        #.

.. container:: option

    CocoaPods
        Run the following command in your project directory. CocoaPods automatically picks up the changes.

        :command:`$ pod update`

        .. note::

            If your pod update command fails, delete :file:`Podfile.lock` and :file:`Pods/`
            and then run :command:`pod install` to cleanly install the SDK.

    Carthage
        Run the following command in your project directory. Carthage automatically updates
        your frameworks with the new changes.

Logging
=======

As of version 2.5.4 of this SDK, logging utilizes `CocoaLumberjack SDK <https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack>`__, a flexible, fast, open source logging framework. It supports many capabilities including the ability to set logging level per output target, for instance, concise messages logged to the console and verbose messages to a log file.

CocoaLumberjack logging levels are additive such that when the level is set to verbose, all messages from the levels below verbose are logged. It is also possible to set custom logging to meet your needs. For more information, see `CocoaLumberjack Logging Levels <https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack/blob/master/Documentation/CustomLogLevels.md>`__.

Changing Logging Level
----------------------

You can change the logging level to suit the phase of your development cycle by importing AWSCore and calling:

    .. container:: option

        iOS - Swift
            :code:`AWSDDLog.sharedInstance().logLevel = .verbose`

            The following logging level options are available:

            - ``.off``
            - ``.error``
            - ``.warning``
            - ``.info``
            - ``.debug``
            - ``.verbose``

            We recommend setting the log level to ``.off`` before publishing to the App Store.

        iOS - Objective-C
            :code:`[AWSDDLog sharedInstance].logLevel = AWSDDLogLevelVerbose;`

            The following logging level options are available:

            - ``AWSDDLogLevelOff``
            - ``AWSDDLogLevelError``
            - ``AWSDDLogLevelWarning``
            - ``AWSDDLogLevelInfo``
            - ``AWSDDLogLevelDebug``
            - ``AWSDDLogLevelVerbose``

            We recommend setting the log level to ``AWSDDLogLevelOff`` before publishing to the App Store.


Targeting Log Output
--------------------

CocoaLumberjack can direct logs to file or used as a framework that integrates with the Xcode console.

To initialize logging to files, use the following code:

    .. container:: option

        iOS - Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                let fileLogger: AWSDDFileLogger = AWSDDFileLogger() // File Logger
                fileLogger.rollingFrequency = TimeInterval(60*60*24)  // 24 hours
                fileLogger.logFileManager.maximumNumberOfLogFiles = 7
                AWSDDLog.add(fileLogger)

        iOS - Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                AWSDDFileLogger *fileLogger = [[AWSDDFileLogger alloc] init]; // File Logger
                fileLogger.rollingFrequency = 60 * 60 * 24; // 24 hour rolling
                fileLogger.logFileManager.maximumNumberOfLogFiles = 7;
                [AWSDDLog addLogger:fileLogger];

To initialize logging to your Xcode console, use the following code:

    .. container:: option

        iOS - Swift
            .. code-block:: swift

                AWSDDLog.add(AWSDDTTYLogger.sharedInstance) // TTY = Xcode console

        iOS - Objective-C
            .. code-block:: objc

                [AWSDDLog addLogger:[AWSDDTTYLogger sharedInstance]]; // TTY = Xcode console

To learn more, see `CocoaLumberjack <https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack>`__ on GitHub.

Install the Reference Documentation in Xcode
============================================

The AWS Mobile SDK for iOS includes documentation in the DocSets format that you can view within
Xcode. The easiest way to install the documentation is to use the macOS terminal.

To install the DocSet for Xcode
-------------------------------

Open the macOS terminal and go to the directory containing the expanded
archive. For example:

    :command:`$ cd ~/Downloads/aws-ios-sdk-2.5.0`

.. note::

    Replace :command:`2.5.0` in the preceding example with the
    version number of the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS that you downloaded.

Create a directory called
:file:`~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets`:


    :command:`$ mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets`

Copy (or move) :file:`documentation/com.amazon.aws.ios.docset`
from the SDK installation files to the directory you created in the previous
step:

    :command:`$ mv documentation/com.amazon.aws.ios.docset ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/`

If Xcode was running during this procedure, restart Xcode. To browse the
documentation, go to :strong:`Help`, click :strong:`Documentation and API Reference`, and select :strong:`AWS Mobile SDK for iOS v2.0 Documentation`
(where '2.0' is the appropriate version number).

Next Steps
==========

- **Run the demos**: View our `sample iOS apps
  <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-iOS-samples>`__ that demonstrate common use cases. To run
  the sample apps, set up the SDK for iOS as described above, and then follow the instructions
  contained in the README files of the individual samples.
